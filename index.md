# Three Joint Robotic Arm
The Three Joint Robotic Arm is made up of four servo motors. One rotates the base, two help bend back and forth, and the last servo opens and closes the claw at the end of the arm. After building the robotic arm, I added a camera to the end of it. Throughout this project, I learned and applied Arduino code and Python. Despite encountering some bugs along the way, I was able to power through and apply the new techinques I learned to my completed project.

# First Milestone

  My first milestone was to put together the 3 joint robotic arm. I had to asseble the hardware and then add the code for the arm. The project includes servo motors, Arduino NANO, a NANO sheild, hardware components of the arm and 9V batteries as a power source. The servos will act as the joints on the arm; it will allow bending and rotation of the robotic arm and opening and closing of the claw end of the arm.
  By this point I had built the arm and added the original final code. In this milestone I also troubleshooted and worked out the problems that arose. Some of the challenges included a misalignment of the servos along the arm due to an assembly error, which I fixed by realigning the servos, and a file grouping error that prevented the joysticks from controlling the arm.
  For my next milestone, I will be adding on to this current arm. I plan to attach a camera to the end of the arm using Raspberry Pi and then link the Pi and Aruino with Bluetooth.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
